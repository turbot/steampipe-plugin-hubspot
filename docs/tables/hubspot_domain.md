# Table: hubspot_domain - Query HubSpot Domains using SQL

HubSpot Domains are resources within the HubSpot platform that represent the domains associated with a particular HubSpot portal. These domains are used to host the content created within HubSpot, including landing pages, blog posts, and other forms of web content. Each domain is unique to a particular portal and contains specific details such as its ID, name, and the timestamps for when it was created and last updated.

## Table Usage Guide

The `hubspot_domain` table provides insights into the domains within HubSpot. As a web content manager or digital marketer, you can explore domain-specific details through this table, including the domain's ID, name, created and updated timestamps, and more. Use this table to maintain an inventory of your domains, track their creation and update times, and manage your web content more effectively.
