# Table: hubspot_deal

In HubSpot, a Deal represents a potential sales opportunity or a specific business transaction that your company is pursuing with a contact or a company. The Deal object is a core component of HubSpot's CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system and is used to track and manage the progress of sales deals from initial contact to closure.
